###  (•_•) Hi there!
- 🐱‍💻 I'm Thomas, a technology evangelist working within the Microsoft cloud ecosystem.
- 📢 Microsoft MVP since 2013 - which basically means I like to talk a lot.
- 👩‍💻 Not much of a developer, does PowerShell count? PowerShell is code too!
- 💻 I've got a website at https://thomasvochten.com
- 🧔 I should probably change my profile picture.
